* Erlang on Alpine Linux
  This Dockerfile provides a full installation of Erlang on Alpine, intended for
  running on CI with minimum dependency and it has no build tools installed. This
  Dockerfile is almost identical with bitwalker/alpine-erlang with additional
  Dialyzer. The caveat of course is if one has NIFs which require a native
  compilation toolchain, but that is left as an exercise for the reader.
* Usage
